This ship served as a luxury escape for the upper echelons of society. [Root.Leader.GetName] has reported that the vessel and its occupants have been travelling the void for an estimated 100,000 years, however, it seems that in the final years of the vessel's operation its passenger numbers swelled. \n\nAn estimated 8,000 individual remains have been identified so far, all in quite cramped conditions. Furthermore it is immediately evident that there are at least seven unique species onboard, with no distinction of wealth and status. However there is simply not enough evidence to theorize on the society that these individuals once came from. \n\nThe survey team hypothesise that the Princera Nessana may have become a vessel for refugees or as an emergency transport ship for military personnel. Whatever the reason, it is clear that the ship never found a friendly port and instead faced a slow death drifting through space as vital systems slowly deteriorated."
