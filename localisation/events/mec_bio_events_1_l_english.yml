###Eruption in the Ether
 mec_bio_evt.001.name:0 "Eruption in the Ether"
 mec_bio_evt.001.desc:0 "A major disaster has transpired on the colony world of [Root.Planet.GetName], in which a civilian starship's mass effect drive core detonated. Most worryingly, the detonation occurred in the vicinity of the colony's main settlement, causing severe damage and injuries. \n\nInitial reports have theorized that upon take-off, the starship's cooling systems failed leading to a cascade failure with the reactor and drive core going into meltdown. The crew and passengers were instantly killed upon detonation, with a few thousand colonists on the surface suffering various injuries due to the impact of the shockwave and debris. \n\nFurther investigation will be necessary to determine the exact cause. In the meantime, all starship operators have been ordered to inspect their vessels for possible faults. Additionally spaceports will alter flight paths for all vessels to avoid similar incidents."

###Industrial Ignition
 mec_bio_evt.002.name:0 "Industrial Ignition"
 mec_bio_evt.002.desc:0 "An element zero refinery on the world of [Root.Planet.GetName] suffered a major fire causing the mass ejection of unrefined and refined element zero into the atmosphere. Fortunately, the atmospheric contamination is relatively localized but has nonetheless led to the evacuation of numerous nearby settlements. Inspectors are still investigating the exact cause of the fire and whether or not any individual or group acted with incompetence or maliciousness. \n\nThe most pressing matter will be the short-term and long-term effects of element zero contamination to the local population and environment."

###Falling Skies
 mec_bio_evt.003.name:0 "Falling Skies"
 mec_bio_evt.003.desc:0 " nearby asteroid has collided with our colony on the world of [Root.Planet.GetName], causing widespread damage and chaos. Unusually, a significant proportion of the asteroid remained intact as it travelled through the atmosphere, leaving a beautiful aurora in its wake. This aurora, however, was unrefined element zero which was subsequently aerosolized above our colony. It is not currently known what the short-term and long-term effects of element zero contamination will be on the local population and environment. \n\nIn the meantime, the asteroid will provide a welcome boost to our mineral reserves."

###Power of Gods
 mec_bio_evt.005.name:0 "Power of Gods"
 mec_bio_evt.005.desc:0 "Following various incidents across our colonies involving element zero, it has been ascertained that individuals exposed to element zero in its dust form undergo non-genetic mutations. \n\nThis most commonly appears as cancerous tumors, however, a number of medical personnel have identified individuals with non-cancerous nodules embedded in body tissue. These nodules are infused with element zero, with initial reports indicating that younger individuals, including those in embryogenesis, being more likely to develop these nodules. \n\nIncredibly there is unsubstantiated evidence that these nodules can generate mass effect fields when energized by electrical impulses from the brain, allowing individuals to interact with items over distance, generate gravitational vortices and create protective barriers. \n\nFor now there is little public information about the affected individuals, with many decrying the media as fake, but further investigation may be warranted."

###Power of Gods - Investigate
 mec_bio_evt.0050.name:0 "Power of Gods"
 mec_bio_evt.0050.desc:0 "Our investigation into individuals with element zero nodules in their body tissue have confirmed that they can in fact generate mass effect fields when energized by electrical impulses from the brain. These unique abilities have been named biotics by our researchers. \n\nPreliminary reports have theorized that exposure is by no means guaranteed to result in biotic ability. On the contrary, most embryos that are exposed are not affected at all. Others will develop brain tumors or other horrific physical complications. It is estimated that one in ten will develop significant biotic potential, though it is possible that exposed individuals may develop biotics in later life if exposed to additional sources. Further research, and likely experimentation, would be required to definitively conclude this theory. \n\nThe current number of affected individuals is limited and we have successfully placed them in quarantine to ensure the safety of themselves and the wider public. It will also have the added benefit of reducing the chance of information leaking about dangers, and benefits, of element zero exposure should we decide to maintain complete secrecy. \n\nAlternatively, the public could be informed about the situation, though how the general public will react to the existence of powered individuals is difficult to predict. \n\nA decision on the future of biotics within our space needs to be made."
 mec_bio_evt.0050.a:0 "Inform the public."

In the meantime, a training facility is being developed to study and develop biotic powers and ascertain the potential use of biotics in a variety of roles, especially within the military. \n\nWorryingly, a very small number of individuals have been identified as wishing to intentionally expose themselves to element zero dust to gain the unique abilities of biotics. They are currently being monitored by our security services, though it has led to various military officers, intelligence officials and scientists arguing for the encouragement of biotics via a variety of means. This includes exposing those with latent biotics to a second dose of element zero, to causing intentional accidents over major populated areas. \n\nIf such an operation was authorized and subsequently became public, the potential fallout would be devastating. To counter this, the operation would begin relatively limited in scope in order to test the validity of several exposure methods. Therefore the immediate risk of an information leak would be minimal."

 mec_bio_evt.0053.desc:0 "As a means to expand our knowledge on biotic development and increase the number of biotics within our space, the first mission involved exposing latent biotics to additional sources of element zero in the hopes of manifesting full biotic ability. \n\nLatent biotics are individuals who possess element zero nodules within their body tissue, but these nodules may contain less element zero or the nodules are not sufficiently integrated throughout the body. Latent biotics make ideal first candidates as they appear to have increased immunity to the toxicity of element zero. \n\nInitial reports on the first operation have been mixed. The means in which the latent biotics were exposed to a second dose, was relatively simple, with covert medical personnel providing access and assistance in the location and exposure of these individuals. However, the rate of biotic manifestation in latent biotics was below expected with only one in twenty gaining full biotic abilities. Nonetheless the high volume of people with latent biotics has produced a significant increase in the biotic population. \n\nThe next operation would be to disperse element zero dust at a variety of smaller settlements across our space, with a focus on colonies with young, growing populations.

With a focus on smaller and younger colonies, our teams were able to disperse element zero dust in relatively localized areas allowing our teams to gain a greater understanding on the necessary exposure levels for the development of full biotic potential. Furthermore, these colonies are typically more rural allowing for easier monitoring of those exposed without detection. \n\nOur researchers have also continued monitoring the previous generation of biotics and have concluded that biotics cannot be passed genetically to offspring. It is now confirmed that the only method of biotic development for our species, as of right now, is via exposure to element zero dust. \n\nThe next stage of the operation calls for the purposeful detonation of starships above our worlds. In most cases these vessels will be remotely operated cargo ships, but to avoid suspicion some will have to be crewed. \n\nThe risks of these operations expands with each step, but so do the possible benefits to the long-term survival and prosperity of our civilization.

Our intelligence agencies are carefully discrediting any reports which suggest that all of the events were intentional. \n\nThe impact of all of these incidents has led to a general wariness of starships and the use of element zero across our worlds. Fortunately, and unfortunately, the exploits identified by our agents to cause the element zero core overloads have been repaired on most spacecraft throughout our space, ensuring that similar disasters will be highly unlikely even when deliberately attempted. \n\nThe next operation will involve the sabotage of various element zero refineries and processing plants throughout our space. It must be stated that such an operation will lead to a notable increase in the biotic population, however, it will undoubtedly lead to countless deaths. Furthermore, it is growing increasingly more difficult to maintain operational deniability. Should we proceed?"

This has, unsurprisingly, led to a serious increase in health related issues in the affected regions and has also led to the closure of various element zero facilities. \n\nUnderstanding the growing cost ethically and financially, as well as the growing discontent amongst many of our operatives in conducting such an operation, it has been decided that it is no longer feasible to continue. \n\nIt is now imperative that all records of this operation are purged and that all individuals involved are aware of the consequences of revealing any information.

Initial reports highlight the growing number and size of mass protests and violence across our worlds, leading to a marked decrease in economic activity. Anti-governmental groups and opposition parties have seized the growing discontent against us and have called for the immediate removal of those in power. Many biotics, despite being the prime beneficiaries of our mission, have joined those in condemning our acts. \n\nIt is quite possible that this revelation may lead to rebellions and insurgencies over the coming years, which may prove difficult to counter if local security forces are sympathetic to the people. \n\nWe must now do all we can to contain the situation and weather the coming storm and hope that history will understand our mission."

The biotics were clearly more of a threat than we anticipated. Worst still was the very public showdown between our forces and the biotics, all of which was captured and uploaded to various networks. Uncomfortable questions are quickly arising as to the presence of these powered individuals. \n\nFurthermore, the biotic subversives managed to distribute a manifesto calling upon biotics and non-biotics alike to rise up against the government. Various insurgent groups and organizations have riled up the populace in response, leading to a significant drop in productivity across our nation. \n\nWe must deploy the full weight of our security and propaganda machine must be used to counter these dissenters."

###Power of Gods - Capture Successful

 mec_bio_evt.0073.desc:0 "The mission to capture the biotic deviants has been a major success, with none of our special forces suffering any losses. A small number of biotics were killed during the operation, mostly caregivers defending the young, the bodies of which have been collected for additional research. \n\nThe captured biotics have now been secured in various facilities across our space, under the supervision of our military forces. Furthermore, the biotics have been separated from familial groups to increase the chances of successful indoctrination and training, especially for the youngest biotics. \n\nIt is hoped that within the next decade that a fully operational regiment will be ready for deployment, which will not only serve as an honor guard, but as an internal and external security force that will encapsulate the ideological purity of our nation."
 mec_bio_evt.0073.a:0 "A new army awaits."

###Power of Gods - Capture Failure

 mec_bio_evt.0074.desc:0 "The mission to capture the biotic deviants has ended in disaster. The majority of the biotics were unfortunately eliminated, as were our elite special forces. The biotics were clearly more of a threat than we anticipated and were fanatical in defending their young. \n\nFortunately, the operation, nor its failure, has become known to the public. The biotic threat has also been substantially reduced, hopefully forever."
 mec_bio_evt.0074.a:0 "A categorical failure."

###Power of Gods - Indoctrinated Army
 mec_bio_evt.0075.name:0 "The Vanguard"
 mec_bio_evt.0075.desc:0 "Our efforts to create a biotic regiment has been successful thanks to the early indoctrination of a significant number of biotic younglings. Whilst the use of biotics in combat has so far been limited, substantial training has highlighted how effective biotic powers can be in offensive and defensive operations and can act as an effective force multiplier. \n\nAs it stands, the existence of biotics remains a closely guarded secret, but if this first biotic regiment proves effective it may be pertinent to expand the biotic population to further enhance our military. For now, the biotic regiment has been bestowed the privilege of acting as an honor guard and specialist force within our nation. \n\nThey will uphold our ideals with zeal and fervor to the last!"
 mec_bio_evt.0075.a:0 "Loyal to the cause."
 mec_bio_evt_0075.a.tooltip:0 "A highly effective specialized force of biotics loyal to the state joins the ranks."

###Power of Gods - Divinity

 mec_bio_evt.0080.desc:0 "The existence of biotics and their divine power has been proclaimed across our worlds. Many have been inspired by the confirmation that our people have been chosen to wield these extraordinary abilities, though there are those that have begun circulating hearsay that biotics are not divine but instead heretics. These apostates are currently being monitored by our security services. \n\nA significant number of people have spoken of their desire to become divinely touched or sire divine offspring. Whilst all information regarding the cause, development, risks and outcomes of element zero exposure has not been disclosed, it is only a matter of time until the rumors begin to circulate. \n\nPerhaps it is the will of the universe that more of our kin gain these heavenly gifts. Time will tell."

 mec_bio_evt.0081.desc:0 "Our people, seeking biotic divinity, have purposefully exposed themselves to element zero dust leading to an explosion in the number of biotics across our space. \n\nMost surprisingly, there has been limited evidence of the negative side effects of element zero exposure amongst the general population. Already various officials are decreeing this as further evidence of divine intervention. Further research into why these adverse effects did not manifest will be a high priority. \n\nOur civilization will undoubtedly prosper side-by-side with our biotically gifted brethren. We are blessed."

 mec_bio_evt.0082.desc:0 "Our people, seeking biotic divinity, have purposefully exposed themselves to element zero dust leading to a wave of health complications and deaths. Though a significant number of adolescents and infants are displaying biotic powers. \n\nThe dangers of biotics and their creation has swept across our space fostering hysteria and panic. A select few have used this panic as a means to push their anti-biotic agenda calling them heretics. \n\nIt may prove beneficial to align ourselves with these doom-sayers and abandon the premise of biotics as divine, however, those who possess such abilities will surely be subjected to a torrent of abuse and hatred. The long term effects of this stigma will be difficult to predict. \n\nAlternatively it may be possible to placate the masses and remind them of the power of the divine, though there is no guarantee that doing so will succeed. \n\nThe fate of biotics as divine or as heretics rests in our hands."

 mec_bio_evt.0083.desc:0 "Across our space biotics have become pariahs at our command. Once considered the bearers of power and divinity by our people, they are now reminders of the dangers of heretical beliefs and playing with other worldly forces. Various media and propaganda networks have assisted in stoking tension and furore amongst the general population. \n\nWhilst a significant minority of biotics exist across our space, they now face growing resentment and hostilities with various groups now calling for their imprisonment and removal from society by any means. In turn biotic communes and underground networks have been established in order to protect themselves from unwarranted attacks. It is only a matter of time until open conflict erupts."

Many biotics are no longer wary of their safety and can now openly display their powers much to the chagrin of some anti-biotic individuals and groups. Though, these individuals and groups have been effectively silenced. \n\nOur journey along the divine path continues alongside our biotic brethren!"
