 mec_asari_origin_illium_desc:0 "The inhospitable planet of Illium, a young Asari colony strategically placed on the border between civilized space and the lawless frontier, has in only a few short centuries managed to outperform even the most optimistic projections.\n\nBut as the glamorous allure of its success attracts ever more wealth and wealth-seekers, the planet's viability for housing a large and productive population is rapidly becoming a concern.\nIf Illium is to keep up with its investors' increasingly impossible expectations, not even nature itself must stand in the way of further development.\n\n§RThis is a unique origin. Only one instance per galaxy is recommended.§!"

 pc_mec_illium_desc:0 "Hot and massive rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Although it does, in theory, fulfil all the conditions of being habitable, very few species would find the extreme conditions on the surface tolerable. Due to the high gravity, turbulent weather and scorching temperatures, colony prospects are concentrated mostly around the temperate polar regions. Closer to the equator, only with advanced habitation technology and by staying at high altitudes might one carve out limited living space."

 d_mec_asari_sulsara_oasis_desc:0 "The gleaming jewel of Sulsara Desert actually shines not because it reflects the scorching sunlight, but because it greedily absorbs every single ray that falls upon its solar-panelled skyscrapers, and then radiates its energy weatlh out to all of Illium.\nAlthough all major arcologies are designed to be self-sustainable in terms of power, Sulsara still makes enormous profits supplying excess energy to clients across the planet for whom enough is never enough.\nIn the long term, the Oasis seeks to cover the entire desert with its solar collectors."
 d_mec_asari_saefos_valley:0 "Saefos Valley"
 d_mec_asari_saefos_valley_desc:0 "The fertile plains of Saefos Valley and its booming population make it one of the planet's most inviting locales. While by no means rural, it is a favoured living place and tourist desitination for those who prefer the polar regions' natural beauty to the artificial skyscrapers of equatorial arcologies. Without, of course, having to leave behind urban comforts."
 d_mec_asari_nosedana_vertical:0 "Nos Edana Vertical Agricologies"
 d_mec_asari_nosedana_vertical_desc:0 "The agricology project of Nos Edana was an agricultural conglomerate's attempt at developing a self-sustainable arcology design during the initial wave of equatorial settlement. While the prototype was successful and the construction of Nos Edana was commissioned according to its design, the conglomerate had failed to account for Illium's rapid population growth.\nIn the end, living and commercial space was deemed too valuable to dedicate entire spires to hydroponic facilities. Polar farmlands and offworld imports became Illium arcologies' primary providers of food.\n\nNonetheless, Nos Edana has managed to carve out a niche for itself as the exclusive producer of locally grown offworld crops cultivated within highly specialized simulated environments."
 d_mec_asari_kyatari_thanoris:0 "Kyatari-Thanoris Twin Cities"
 d_mec_asari_kyatari_thanoris_desc:0 "Independently but simultanously constructed along the same mountain chain, the cities of Kyatari and Thanoris practically grew up together. At first the mining concerns that built them were in fierce competition, each vying for monopoly over the mountains' virgin mineral wealth, but as the inhabitants of the twin cities came to rely on each other's trade and complementary amenities, the companies' investors forced them to break the 126-year stalemate and enter a more productive partnership.\n\nAnd so they came together to exploit their joint infrastructure and workforce happily ever after."
 d_mec_asari_sedera_canyon:0 "Sedera Canyon"
 d_mec_asari_sedera_canyon_desc:0 "A relatively young geological formation cutting deeply into the planet's largest landmass. The canyon owes its existence to a combination of a regularly overflowing sea and convergence of tectonic plates. It is speculated that over billions of years the geological activity may lead to the complete separation of the landmass into two continents and the Sedera river to become a sea of its own.\n\nNone of that, however, is as important to the inhabitants of Illium as the vast mineral weatlh exposed by the ever-generous forces of erosion."
 d_mec_asari_azarbilhos_industrial:0 "Azar Bilhos Industrial District"
 d_mec_asari_azarbilhos_industrial_desc:0 "Azar Bilhos, meaning "Heart of Steel", has become the premier location for the production of all basic components. During the first wave of colonization, the Azar Bilhos Industrial District was focused on the construction of prefabricated units, however, in time the district would diversify into other industries. Many of Illium’s corporations have offices and factories within the district, as well as housing for the many workers, both paid and indentured."
 
 d_mec_asari_equatorial_hostile:0 "£blocker£ Hostile Equatorial Surface"
 d_mec_asari_equatorial_hostile_desc:0 "The conditions in the equatorial regions of this hot and massive planet are beyond the tolerance levels of most organic species.\nHowever, their natural resources can still be exploited to an extent, and populations can escape the extreme heat of the surface by building their cities within massive skyscraper arcologies."
 d_mec_asari_arcology_unfinished:0 "£blocker£ Abandoned Arcology Project"
 d_mec_asari_arcology_unfinished_desc:0 "This near-equatorial arcology settlement once had the ambition of rivalling Nos Astra in size and opulence. Unfortunately, after merely establishing the foundations, the corporation that acquired the land and commissioned the city declared bankrupcy and vanished without trace, leaving this eyesore to take up valuable space and a sizeable population of workers to fend for themselves, unpaid to this day."
 d_mec_asari_nosparnalo_quarantine:0 "£blocker£ Nos Parnalo Quarantine Zone"
 d_mec_asari_nosparnalo_quarantine_desc:0 "The city of Nos Parnalo was once a prosperous metropolis that had the potential to become Illium's centre of trade and de facto capital.\nHowever, when surveyor Verallas returned to port after the preliminary exploration of the Zelene system, unbeknownst to the crew, it brought back a handful of chlorine-fixing microbes native to the planet Nepyma.\nExposed to the temperate environment replete with unused chlorine, the microbes proceeded to reproduce, devouring the chlorides in the earth and leaving toxic polychlorinated biphenyls as metabolic byproducts.\n\nBy the time the infestation was contained, an area of nearly 30 square kilometers had been effectively turned into a toxic waste dump. Nos Parnalo had to be abandoned, accelerating the development of Nos Astra."
 d_mec_asari_nosparnalo_research:0 "Nos Parnalo Black Site"
 d_mec_asari_nosparnalo_research_desc:0 "Although there is little chance that the toxic area will support life again within a reasonable timeframe, the Nepyma Microbes and their effect on the planet's environment are of some scientific interest.\n\nParts of the dead city have been repurposed into a research complex dedicated to their study, surrounded by heavy military fortifications and sentries ordered to open fire on anything that comes within weapons range without the proper clearance. Or anyone claiming to be there for a surprise inspection."
 d_mec_asari_makeara_slums:0 "£blocker£ Makeara Slums"
 d_mec_asari_makeara_slums_desc:0 "A large bay at the edge of the northern polar region, surrounded by a number of seaside settlements established in the early years of Illium's colonization. However, as arcology urbanization started to take hold and attracted the interest of investors, these rural settlements were largely abandoned by corporations and populations alike.\n\nThe region is still technically inhabited, but the remaining population is unsupervised and the Bay is believed to be a major smuggling hub."
 d_mec_asari_makeara_bay:0 "Makeara Bay"
 d_mec_asari_makeara_bay_desc:0 "A large bay at the edge of the northern polar region, surrounded by a number of seaside settlements established in the early years of Illium's colonization. The local fishing industry used to feed the early colonists and the bountiful marine life was highly prized offworld as expensive pets and exotic cuisine. At least until unregulated exploitation led to the extincion of many native species.\n\nInvestors' interest in Makeara Bay suddenly renewed when ongoing research on cloning presented the possibility of bringing the dearly missed delicacies back to life."
 d_mec_asari_esiyo_jungle:0 "£blocker£ Esiyo Jungle"
 d_mec_asari_esiyo_jungle_desc:0 "Although excessive vegetation is scarce in both the scorched equator and the temperate polar regions, there is a significant landmass in the southern subequatorial zone which supports abundant growth. That primodial jungle has resisted all conventional methods of deforestation and was judged unfeasable for both ground settlement and arcology construction, ironically rendering the planet's most life-bearing region impossible to live in."
 d_mec_asari_esiyo_urban:0 "£blocker£ Esiyo Urbanization Project"
 d_mec_asari_esiyo_urban_desc:0 "While the full extent of damage to the local ecosystem has yet to be fully assessed, the effectivness of modified Nepyma Microbes at preparing once untamable land for large-scale construction cannot be disputed. With most of Esiyo Jungle out of the way, the foundations of a new arcology complex have been laid out and secured against natural reclamation."
 d_mec_asari_eos_metropolis:0 "Nos Eos"
 d_mec_asari_eos_metropolis_desc:0 "Nos Eos is an interconnected complex of arcologies built over what was once the Esiyo Jungle, some of which still remains around the foot of the massive towers. Unlike most arcologies on Illium, Nos Eos covers a wide area, expanding by adding additional smaller arcologies rather than building up vertically. It is designed to serve as the staging point for further subequatorial urbanization."
 d_mec_asari_sub_equatorial_land:0 "£blocker£ Subequatorial Deposits"
 d_mec_asari_sub_equatorial_land_desc:0 "The subequatorial regions of Illium tend to be the easiest to exploit. While the conditions on the surface are still quite unbearable and unsuited for organic habitation, infrastructure is much easier to maintain and the operational costs of heavy machinery fall within acceptable parameters.\n\nIt is nevertheless quite a lot of valuable space that could be adapted for arcology settlement in the future, once the mineral deposits are no longer needed."
 d_mec_asari_tartaos_fissures:0 "£blocker£ Tartaos Fissures"
 d_mec_asari_tartaos_fissures_desc:0 "Volcanically active and tectonically unstable, the Tartaos region features far more products of geological activity than just fissures but that tends to be the first thing observers notice. Although on the surface the land might look dire, if it could be stabilized, establishing specially adapted urban infrastructure would be the easy part."
 d_mec_asari_euridia_conglomerate:0 "Euridia Conglomerate"
 d_mec_asari_euridia_conglomerate_desc:0 "Euridia Conglomerate is a collection of arcologies constructed by a corporate alliance known by the same name. After the volatile Tartaos region was stabilized, the industrial giant wasted no time moving in, making quite an impression with how quickly they were able to erect multiple cities in a land once believed uninhabitable."

 mec_asari_decision_origin_illium_ecumenopolis:0 "Complete Project Architect"
 mec_asari_decision_origin_illium_ecumenopolis_desc:0 "With the final phase of Project Architect, urban infrastructure will expand to encompass the entire planet, burying whatever remains of its natural environment underfoot countless arcologies."

 d_mec_asari_neo_nosastra:0 "Nos Astra"
 d_mec_asari_neo_nosastra_desc:0 "The name of Illium's capital city is the first thing one hears upon entering the system, followed by advertisements for every product and service imaginable. Goods, entertainment, information or anything else one might desire, Nos Astra's lavish commercial districts can either provide it or import it. The beating heart of Illium's commerce and tourism encompasses multiple titanic arcologies housing shops, venues, corporate headquarters and, of course, the planet's largest starport servicing an endless stream of shuttle traffic."
 d_mec_asari_neo_manjoros:0 "Manjoros Plaza"
 d_mec_asari_neo_manjoros_desc:0 ""Plaza" might at this point be a bit of a misnomer, since the scope of Manjoros now encompasses several arcologies' worth of corporate offices and administrative institutions, with countless remote branches throughout the planet, all dedicated to ensuring that mag-trains run on time and credits flow unhindered. With the evolution of Illium, its notoriously efficient bureaucracy has adapted as well."
 d_mec_asari_neo_saefos:0 "Saefos Gardens"
 d_mec_asari_neo_saefos_desc:0 "An idyllic enclave of tranquility amidst a global city that never sleeps, the former Saefos Valley is now a large complex dedicated to the preservation of what little remains of Illium's natural ecosystem. Bioscience facilities cultivate genetic archives of native species while tourists have a chance to visit the many simulated habitats and see what the world's most beautiful locales once looked like, or at least an artistic interpretation thereof."
 d_mec_asari_neo_nosparnalo:0 "Nos Parnalo"
 d_mec_asari_neo_nosparnalo_desc:0 "Once destroyed by an infestation of Nepyma Microbes, Nos Parnalo was revived as part of Project Architect, with no trace of the old quarantine zone remaining. In its new incarnation, the city has attracted a number of militech companies and quickly become the prime destination to acquire cutting-edge weaponry as well as personnel trained to use it. Business is booming as the wealthy and paranoid spare no expenses to protect their interests."
 d_mec_asari_neo_sulsara:0 "Sulsara Complex"
 d_mec_asari_neo_sulsara_desc:0 "The power company that once operated in the Sulsara Oasis has since gone global. Sulsara's signature solar collectors and various other solutions meant to alleviate the prohibitive energy consumption of arcologies are now standard throughout Illium. Meanwhile, the Sulsara Complex itself has become a thriving metropolis housing some of the most productive industries on the planet."

 mec_asari_asi.201.name:0 "Project Architect"
 mec_asari_asi.201.desc:0 "A few centuries of meteoric growth have turned Illium into an economic powerhouse, far outstripping much older and more established Asari worlds. Yet, since its founding, the long-term sustainability of the colony has been the subject of near-constant debate. Our ingenious arcology complexes have so far allowed us to settle otherwise uninhabitable areas, but unfortunately not all expansion projects have gone to plan in the recent past, and the Board is growing increasingly concerned that Illium's short-term success may eventually be undermined by its limited potential in the scope of the next couple of centuries.\n\nProject Architect was engineered to assuage those fears. By systemically removing all obstacles to planetary expansion and adapting engineering paradigms to meet new challenges, the end goal of the initiative is to envelop the entire planet in urban infrastructure, using up every cubic nanometer of space to shatter the very concept of glass ceiling. If successful, Illium's future will be secured for millenia to come. If not... the investors we have convinced to pour quadrillions of credits into it will eat us alive with Uleese ultraviolet truffle marinara sauce.\n\nOverrated cuisine aside, the first major step of the plan involves completing several ongoing arcology constructions. One of them is of particular interest - §Y$d_mec_asari_arcology_unfinished$§! - it was deserted early in developement, along with the workforce commissioned to build it. Most of those assets remain in the area and could potentially still be exploited."

Going forward, the Board is willing to entrust it with larger undertakings.\n\nNaturally, these challenges will not be quite as straightforward. Specialized methodologies will need to be developed in order to approach them. A special task force within the £society£ §YSociety Research§! department has been created for that purpose.\n\nTwo major projects currently await budget allocation:\n\n£society£ §YExplanetary Resource Exploitation§! involves establishing a research facility within the §Y$d_mec_asari_nosparnalo_quarantine$§! for the purpose of assessing the Nepyma Microbe's potential as a terraforming agent.\n\n£society£ §YIncentive Redefinition Strategy§! revolves around dealing with the §Y$d_mec_asari_makeara_slums$§!, a settled but unsupervised region that has become a liability and should be repurposed into something more useful."

Although the unfortunate incident that led to the infestation and subsequent abandonment of Nos Parnalo set the development of Illium back several decades in its early days, we believe that something may still be gained from the cause of that disaster. Several scientifically-minded companies associated with Project Architect have always been fascinated with the environmental effects of Nepyma Microbes and have proposed that it might be possible to create a more... contained version of the microscopic menace.\n\nThe potential it could have for Project Architect's terraforming efforts cannot be ignored. In fact, we already have a specific purpose in mind - defoliation of the untamable §Y$d_mec_asari_esiyo_jungle$§!.

Countless credits were spent and all conventional means of deforestation exhausted in vain attempts to carve out sufficient room for urban construction, only for nature to reclaim lost ground in a matter of months. Until now.\n\nUtilizing a modified strain of the Nepyma Microbes, we have cleared over 70% of the region, creating vast room for arcology construction at the low, low cost of the local ecosystem.\n\nAnd although it might horrify the environmentalist lobby, we do believe that this solution was the lesser evil in the end.\nThe only other option deemed viable would have involved saturation bombardment from orbit.

Any failure from this point onwards would carry astronomical costs, and let's not forget that the prospect of becoming an expensive dinner course is still on the table.\n\nAs such, before we commit any significant effort to the first item on the list - founding an entire metropolis from the ground up on the site of §Y$d_mec_asari_esiyo_urban$§! - we should develop reliable operational procedures and logistical infrastructure to facilitate the task.

From there, colonizing the rest of the Esiyo region and similar zones across the planet will be trivial.\n\nAnd yet, in spite of the obvious efficiency, some detractors continue to question our approach to clearing the Esiyo Jungle. The consensus is still that the savage wilderness had to go, but some believe the procedure to have been unnecessarily wasteful and that we could have harvested more resources before proceeding with defoliation.\n\nIn hindsight, the criticism does have some merit. Before we move on to the next part of the plan, which admittedly will render some §Y$d_mec_asari_sub_equatorial_land$§! unavailable for exploitation, we should have the task force come up with a viable strategy for £society£ §YMass Resource Acquisition§!."

More than just a simple holy site and museum, the Temple of Athame hides within its architecture a beacon and archive left behind by alien precursors, referred to as the "Protheans".\n\nThis beacon has provided limited yet vital advancements to asari civilization, despite only being known to a select few within the highest echelons of the asari governments and militaries. We now possess the technological capability to begin actively investigating the beacon and unlocking the secrets still held within.

The latest set of data packets we have managed to access contain a wealth of information focused on construction and agriculture. The agricultural data includes detailed genomes of alien plants that no longer seem to exist in our galaxy, which could be reconstructed or modified into our own flora for increased yields and hardier crops.\nHowever, stringent environmental controls would be needed to exclude the possibility of contaminating the local ecosystem, but the seemingly unrelated files on advanced construction techniques seem to account for just that, containing blueprints for ingenious sealed environment systems. Both will be instrumental to the development of new colonies and space stations.\n\nOne of the senior researchers on the project has suggested that finding both at the same time was no coincidence. She theorizes that the most recent data packets from the beacon may not simply be being decrypted by our technicians, but instead a deliberate delivery of key technologies when pre-programmed requisites are met. The implication is that the precursors intentionally left the beacon behind as a means to guide us even after their departure, and not simply as a remnant of their own research.

 d_mec_asari_helyme_editos_ocean:0 "Editos Ocean"
 d_mec_asari_helyme_editos_ocean_desc:0 "The southern pole of Helyme lacks a distinct landmass and as such has become a hotspot for violent storms in the midst of the open ocean, intensified further by the extreme axial tilt of the planet which leads to remarkably turbulent seasonal changes. If harnessed, those phenomena could provide a significant source of renewable energy; potentially an asset to colonization endeavours, assuming the colony could weather the storm."

 #Helyme
 d_mec_asari_epho_arthenn_traces:0 "Arthenn Traces"
 d_mec_asari_epho_arthenn_traces_desc:0 "Little remains of the ancient Arthenn infrastructure on the planet. In fact, were it not for shattered remains of magnetic levitation rails that have somehow gone undisturbed for hundreds of thousands of years, one might mistake the desolate world for one untouched by civilization. However, the large craters scattered across the surface suggest that the planet was more than just touched. It would appear those scars were caused by hypervelocity kinetic impactor bombardment, very deliberately targeting points connected by the magrail network; likely what would have been arthenn settlements."
 d_mec_asari_epho_zapote_caves:0 "Zapote Caves"
 d_mec_asari_epho_zapote_caves_desc:0 "The abundance of water across Epho has led to the creation of an intricate network of caverns across the surface. Whilst this in itself is a natural wonder, recent surveys have found that it has led to large quantities of palladium deposits unearthed in a region called Zapote. Undoubtedly, the arthenn were mining for these deposits too, but vast amounts of the minerals remain."

 mec_asari_mod_planet_epho_atmosphere:0 "Carbon-Dominant Atmosphere"
 mec_asari_mod_planet_epho_atmosphere_desc:0 "Epho's atmosphere is approximately 41% carbon dioxide at sea level, far in excess of the amount required to render most organic species unconscious in a matter of minutes. Regardless of altitude, all who land on the surface are required to wear breathing masks. Illium's mining consortiums recommend using robotic workers to undertake all heavy labour."

 #Sanves
 d_mec_asari_sanves_tesanda_caldera:0 "Tesanda Caldera"
 d_mec_asari_sanves_tesanda_caldera_desc:0 "This massive sinkhole is the result of the region's volatile volcanic activity. While the caldera and its surroundings are awash in untapped mineral deposits, the fact that it continues to be the sole outlet for frequent eruptions in the area poses significant challenges to establishing permanent mining infrastructure."
 d_mec_asari_sanves_tesanda_quarry:0 "Tesanda Quarry"
 d_mec_asari_sanves_tesanda_quarry_desc:0 "Artificially relieving gas pressure and redirecting the flow of magma allowed us to render the Tesanda Caldera volcanically inert. The rich deposits of minerals brought up from the depths of the planet over ages of frequent eruptions are now relatively safe to mine and the formerly unstable, earthquake-torn region offers vast space for settlement. Reports indicate that the region is awash with spectacular gemstones."
 d_mec_asari_sanves_etheai_arcologies:0 "Etheai Arcologies"
 d_mec_asari_sanves_etheai_arcologies_desc:0 "The city of Etheai has two claims to fame; it is the first permanent city founded by the asari beyond Parnitha and it is the undisputed capital of self-sufficiency within asari space. Various environmental organisations call Etheai home and have aided in developing a state of the art sustainable energy system that powers the city of Etheai and other sporadic settlements across Sanves. "
 d_mec_asari_sanves_ulemas_forests:0 "Forests of Ulemas"
 d_mec_asari_sanves_ulemas_forests_desc:0 "The untamed wilderness and sprawling forests of Sanves are home to billions of diverse species of flora and fauna. Xenobiologists, tourists and hunters alike are keen to explore the rich biodiversity Sanves has to offer. Their ongoing debate as to how such an environment and resource should be treated is older than the colony itself and will most likely never achieve consensus."

 #Niacal
 d_mec_asari_niacal_jungles:0 "Jungles of Niacal"
 d_mec_asari_niacal_jungles_desc:0 "The plant life on Niacal is extremely dense and prolific. Removing the jungle is theoretically possible, however, it is likely that any non-urbanized areas will be reclaimed within a few months. Therefore a gentler approach may actually prove more beneficial in the long term.\n\nResearchers propose that colonists use a variety of methods to ensure continued agricultural output, such as crop-rotation and polycultures."
 d_mec_asari_niacal_tumilasal_delta:0 "Tumilasal Great Delta"
 d_mec_asari_niacal_tumilasal_delta_desc:0 "Located on the northern continent, the Tumilasal river system flows east eventually entering Niacal’s largest ocean. The various tributaries of Tumilasal create a delta covering over 50 kilometers. The soil is extremely fertile and would be perfect for agricultural development."
 d_mec_asari_niacal_aurolis:0 "Aurolis Bio-Science Institute"
 d_mec_asari_niacal_aurolis_desc:0 "Whilst Niacal is one of the younger asari colonies, it has quickly gained a reputation as being the premier location for agribusiness and biotechnology. To further develop these key industries on the planet, the city of Aurolis founded the Aurolis Bio-Science Institute, which quickly gained prominence throughout asari space and attracted veritable droves of investors."

 mec_asari_mod_planet_niacal_atmosphere:0 "Elevated Oxygen Atmosphere"
 mec_asari_mod_planet_niacal_atmosphere_desc:0 "Niacal is a lush planet with an overabundance of photosynthetic life, leading to an atmosphere rich with oxygen. The atmospheric conditions may present difficulties to a variety of species that can suffer from oxygen toxicity. Despite this, the planet is a prime candidate for agricultural production."

 #Lusia
 d_mec_asari_lusia_monoi_metropolis:0 "Monoi Metropolis"
 d_mec_asari_lusia_monoi_metropolis_desc:0 "Despite being colonized nearly half a century behind Sanves, Lusia rapidly overtook it; attributable to a more comfortable gravity, atmosphere and temperature in comparison to its older sister.\nThis population boom led to the colony becoming the Republics' most thriving colony and a vital hub of industry. The growing metropolis of Monoi stands as a symbol of the continuing prosperity and growing status of Lusia and its people."
 d_mec_asari_lusia_tatenis_chain:0 "Tatenis Chain"
 d_mec_asari_lusia_tatenis_chain_desc:0 "The Tatenis Chain is a highly geologically active region stretching from the equator to the northern pole. The area presents an ideal opportunity to install vast geothermal power systems to fuel Lusia's growing industries. Whilst the region is highly volatile and the generators will likely have to be remotely operated, the benefits far outweight the costs. "
 d_mec_asari_lusia_shali_desert:0 "Shali Desert"
 d_mec_asari_lusia_shali_desert_desc:0 "The Shali Desert is an expansive desert across Lusia's southern continent which is home to an abundance of rare metals including platinum, cobalt, palladium and iridium. The vast mineral wealth found within the Shali Desert has been a favourite subject of debate amongst asari geologists for centuries. One of the more interesting, if difficult to verify, theories suggests that the minerals might have arrived from another part of the system, possibly ejected from the orbit of Niagolon whose extensive ring system would suggest the existence of rocky moons in the past."
 d_mec_asari_lusia_noskonetis:0 "Nos Konetis"
 d_mec_asari_lusia_noskonetis_desc:0 "Nos Konetis is a rapidly growing industrial city in Lusia. Founded by two industrial giants; Konrith Enterprises and Spath Consolidated as an colony for their joint workforce, it has quickly grown to become an important keystone in Lusia's mining industry. Whilst it lacks the charm and allure of Monoi, it is quickly becoming apparent that Nos Konetis may soon rival its older sister in simple wealth as long as the resources keep flowing into the beating heart of the city."
