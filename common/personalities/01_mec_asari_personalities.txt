##### Behaviours:
# conqueror -> Will they conquer planets from other empires?
# subjugator -> Will they vassalise other empires?
# liberator -> Will they liberate conquered empires?
# opportunist -> Are they more likely to attack someone already embroiled in war?
# uplifter -> Will they uplift and enlighten other species?
# infiltrator -> Will they infiltrate primitives?
# dominator -> Will they invade primitives?
# slaver -> Will they enslave pops?
# purger -> Will they purge alien pops?
# robot_exploiter -> Will they use robots for menial labor?
# robot_liberator -> Will they give rights to robots?
# propagator -> Will they only get aggressive once boxed in?
# multispecies -> Will they give rights to aliens?
# species_mod_priority = {}		define weights for how much the AI should try to modify a given species (root=country, this=species)

##### Modifiers:
# aggressiveness -> Chance of declaring wars
# trade_willingness -> At 1.0 willingness they will accept a deal that is equally good for both sides
# bravery -> Affects the chance that they will pick rivals & war targets of similar strength instead of picking on the weak
# military_spending -> Affects mineral & energy budget that goes to navies and armies
# colony_spending -> Affects mineral & energy budget that goes to new colonies
# threat_modifier -> Affects how much threat is generated for this empire when others are conquered
# threat_others_modifier -> Afffects how much threat is generated for other empires when this empire is conquered
# friction_modifier -> Affects border friction

# Ships
# armor_ratio -> Amount of armor they should aim for on ships
# shields_ratio -> Amount of shields they should aim for on ships

##### Diplomacy:
# federation_acceptance -> Added directly to chance of accepting to form/join a federation
# nap_acceptance -> Added directly to chance of accepting to form a non-aggression pact
# migration_pact_acceptance -> Added directly to chance of accepting to form a migration pact
# defensive_pact_acceptance -> Added directly to chance of accepting to form a defensive pact

##### Diplomacy:
# advanced_start_chance -> Likelyhood of this empire being an advanced start (higher = better chance of being one of empires selected for advanced start)
